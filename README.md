# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant complication of diabetes,
leading to vision impairment if not detected and treated early. This study
focuses on improving the accuracy of DR detection by employing a combination of pre-processing techniques and leveraging the MobileNetV2 architecture for image classification. The dataset used comprises retinal
images obtained from diabetic patients.
The pre-processing steps involve image enhancement, noise reduction,
and contrast adjustment to optimize the input data for subsequent analysis. MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture, is then employed for feature extraction and classification due to its
efficiency in real-time applications.
The initial evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates an overall accuracy of 80
This research highlights the importance of not solely relying on overall accuracy and emphasizes the need for a more nuanced evaluation,
considering metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The findings
underscore the potential for further refinement in the model to enhance
its ability to correctly identify and classify diabetic retinopathy cases, ultimately contributing to more effective early diagnosis and intervention.
Future work may involve fine-tuning model parameters, exploring additional pre-processing techniques, and expanding the dataset to improve
overall performance.
