# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant complication of diabetes, leading to vision impairment if not detected and treated early. This project mainly focuses on  pre-processing the retinal images dataset obtained from diabetic patients.
For the experimentation we have used only MobileNetV2 pretrained model. We can use different models and we will get exceptional accuracy. Our main focus was to preprocess the data in a way that model can efectively learn from that data. and we are able to achieve it. By following our Preprocessing steps we can test different model like R.esNet-50,ResNet-50v2, ResNet-101V2, ResNet-1502 to get exceptional result.

The pre-processing steps involve image enhancement, noise reduction, and contrast adjustment to optimize the input data for subsequent analysis. MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture, is then employed for feature extraction and classification due to its efficiency in real-time applications.
